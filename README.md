# oh yeah you know it

its that time of year again BABEY

time for me to make nightmares (but speedy quick!)

I'm also taking the opportunity to start learning Haskell both because I've been interested in the
language for a while and also because I really want to get working with Clash (HDL). (System)Verilog
kinda sucks pretty bad so I'm trying to pick up some other options. To that end, I'll attempt to get
at least some of the problems this year done with Clash once I've gotten a bit of learning about it
done.


...Oh, VHDL, you say? LMAO
